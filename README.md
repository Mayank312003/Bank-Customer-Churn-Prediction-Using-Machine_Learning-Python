# 🏦 Bank Customer Churn Prediction
This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a bank customer will leave (churn) or remain with the bank.
Customer churn prediction helps financial institutions identify at-risk customers early and take proactive retention measures, improving long-term profitability and customer satisfaction.
The project covers the complete data science workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify key factors influencing customer churn
- Build predictive models to classify churn vs non-churn customers
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics
- Generate actionable insights to support customer retention strategies

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains customer information such as:
- Customer demographics
- Account balance
- Credit score
- Geography
- Gender
- Age
- Tenure
- Number of products
- Active membership status
- Estimated salary
- Churn status (target variable)

## 🔍 Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
- Removed irrelevant features (IDs, names, etc.)
- Handled missing values
- Encoded categorical variables
- Feature scaling using standardization

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution analysis of customer features
- Churn comparison across demographics
- Correlation analysis between variables
- Data visualization for pattern discovery

3. Model Building
Machine learning models used: XBGClassifier

4. Model Evaluation
Performance measured using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC-AUC Score

## 📈 Key Insights
- Certain demographics show higher churn probability
- Account activity and product usage strongly influence retention
- Customers with low engagement are more likely to churn
- Machine learning models can effectively identify high-risk customers

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 💡 Business Impact

This model helps banks:
- Predict customer churn risk
- Improve retention strategies
- Reduce revenue loss
- Target high-risk customers with personalized offers
